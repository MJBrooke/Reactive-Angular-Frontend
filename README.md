# Reactive Angular Frontend

Angular 5 frontend that will demonstrate the consumption of Spring 5's reactive Server-Side Event WebFlux endpoints.

It subscribes to the Reactive Tweets endpoint in the [Reactive Spring Server](https://github.com/MJBrooke/Reactive-Spring-Server) and continually updates the UI with new Tweets received.


## Running the Project

Simply run 'npm start' to create the dev server and automatically setup the proxy configuration to point to localhost:8080 (where the server runs).
